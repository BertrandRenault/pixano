As Pixano requires specific versions for its dependencies, we recommend creating a new Python virtual environment to install it.

For example, with conda:

```shell
conda create -n pixano_env python=3.10
conda activate pixano_env
```

Then, you can install the Pixano package inside that environment with pip:

```shell
pip install pixano
```
